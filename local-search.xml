    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to my world! This is my first blog. Nice to meet you :)  </p><p>Maybe you don’t know me yet. So before our journey, let me introduce myself firstly.</p><p>I am freya-popo. I studied astronomy as an undergraduate and did some research on exoplanets. After graduation, I studied data science and earned my first master’s degree. Now I am working on my second master’s degree in applied computer science.  </p><p>Although I am still a DS track student, I want to learn more about computer science.  </p><p>Therefore, in this blog, I’m going to update some of my study notes about computer science and other interesting topics, although some of them may be very superficial.</p><p>Also, I am going to update some other content, such as novels (yas! I wrote some stories, though not many people read them), travel guides and MasterChef Series.</p><p>Once again, nice to meet you! :)</p><p><img src="/img/0.jpg"></p>]]></content>
